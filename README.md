## Problem data.zip
This file contains the problem data $p_1$, $p_2$, $\Sigma$ for equation (21) in Section 5 of the original paper.

## Reformulation.py
The script reformulates a CCO problem as a neural network learning problem.

It corresponds to Sections 2 and 3.

## Algorithm 1 to solve multiple alpha.py
The script solves the CCO problem with multiple confidence levels.

It implements the Algorithm 1 in Section 4.
